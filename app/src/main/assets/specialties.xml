        <description>Legal Medicine is a special field of medicine that focuses on various aspects
            of medicine and law. Historically, the practice of legal medicine made contributions to
            medicine as a scientific instrument to solve criminal perplexities. Since World War II,
            the domain of legal medicine has broadened to include not only aspects of medical
            science to solve legal and criminal problems but aspects of law as it applies to
            medicine. Legal Medicine continues to grow as medicolegal issues like medical
            malpractice and liability, government regulation of health care, issues of tort reform,
            and moral and ethical complexities presented by technological advances become
            increasingly prominent. Many medical schools have implemented courses which supply
            medicolegal instruction for medical students, and many law schools now offer medicolegal
            courses. Also, dual degree programs in law and medicine have been created to assist
            physicians to bridge the gap between medicine and the law.

        <description>An occupational therapy assistant is a person who has graduated from an
            occupational therapy assistant program accredited by the Accreditation Council for
            Occupational Therapy Education (ACOTE) or predecessor organizations, has successfully
            completed a period of supervised fieldwork experience required by the accredited
            occupational therapy assistant program, has passed a nationally recognized entry-level
            examination for occupational therapy assistants, and fulfills state requirements for
            licensure, certification, or registration. An occupational therapy assistant provides
            interventions under the supervision of an occupational therapist which emphasize the
            therapeutic use of everyday life activities (i.e., occupations) with individuals or
            groups for the purpose of facilitating participation in roles and situations and in
            home, school, workplace, community and other settings. Occupational therapy services are
            provided for the purpose of promoting health and wellness and are provided to those who
            have or are at risk for developing an illness, injury, disease, disorder, condition,
            impairment, disability, activity limitation, or participation restriction. Occupational
            therapy assistants address the physical, cognitive, psychosocial, sensory, and other
            aspects of occupational performance in a variety of contexts to support engagement in
            everyday life activities that affect health, well-being, and quality of life.

        <description>Occupational therapy assistants provide environmental modifications under the
            supervision of an occupational therapist. OTAs develop and implement an individualized
            occupational therapy environmental modification plan that reflects the relevant contexts
            of the client and relevant others and maximizes current and future occupational
            performance, safety, and participation of the client. Clients receive environmental
            modification recommendations and interventions that enable them to meet occupational
            performance and participation goals and that have adequate flexibility to accommodate
            for their future needs.

        <description>Occupational therapy assistants contribute to the completion of an
            individualized occupational therapy low-vision evaluation under the direction and
            supervision of the occupational therapist to identify factors that may facilitate,
            compensate for, or inhibit use of vision in occupational performance. Clients are
            engaged in the identification of strengths, limitations, and goals as they relate to low
            vision to optimize independence and participation in desired occupations. Occupational
            therapy assistants also contribute to the development and implementation of an
            individualized occupational therapy low-vision intervention plan in collaboration with
            the occupational therapist, client, and relevant others that reflects the client's
            priorities for occupational performance.

        <description>Occupational therapy assistants contribute to the completion of an
            individualized occupational therapy driving and community mobility evaluation by
            administering delegated assessments and identifying findings that impact the client's
            occupational performance. Clients engage in the assessment and occupational profile
            process to customize the evaluation to their individual driving and community mobility
            needs. Occupational therapy assistants administer and continuously modify individualized
            in-vehicle and community mobility assessments within the naturalistic context of the
            community in response to the occupational performance and safety behaviors of the
            client. They also implement an individualized intervention plan, within the parameters
            established in collaboration with the occupational therapist that reflects the contexts
            of the client and meets his or her occupational performance and safety needs.
            Occupational therapy assistants address immediate and long-term implications of
            psychosocial issues related to compromised driving and community mobility throughout the
            occupational therapy process and makes recommendations to the occupational therapist for
            modification to service delivery.

            in the critical care settings are arterial blood gas puncture and analysis, intrarterial
            monitoring, bedside measurements of lung mechanics, hemodynamic monitoring, and inspired
            and expired gas measurements. This is coupled with the initiation and management of
            mechanical ventilation patients.

            of the individual.

            occupational therapy program accredited by the Accreditation Council for Occupational
            Therapy Education (ACOTE) or predecessor organizations, or approved by the World
            Federation of Occupational Therapists (WFOT), or an equivalent international
            occupational therapy education program; has successfully completed a period of
            supervised fieldwork experience required by the occupational therapy program; has passed
            a nationally recognized entry-level examination for occupational therapists, and
            fulfills state requirements for licensure, certification, or registration. An
            occupational therapist provides interventions based on evaluation and which emphasize
            the therapeutic use of everyday life activities (i.e., occupations) with individuals or
            groups for the purpose of facilitating participation in roles and situations and in
            home, school, workplace, community and other settings. Occupational therapy services are
            provided for the purpose of promoting health and wellness and are provided to those who
            have or are at risk for developing an illness, injury, disease, disorder, condition,
            impairment, disability, activity limitation, or participation restriction. Occupational
            therapists address the physical, cognitive, psychosocial, sensory, and other aspects of
            occupational performance in a variety of contexts to support engagement in everyday life
            activities that affect health, well-being, and quality of life.

        <description>Occupational therapy practitioners are experts at identifying the cause of
            difficulties in performance of activities of daily living and instrumental activities of
            daily living. Occupational therapy practitioners evaluate the client, their environment,
            and their occupational performance in that environment, as well as make recommendations
            for products to improve the fit between the client, place, and activity. Occupational
            therapists can evaluate both the skills of the client and the environmental features
            that support or limit the performance of meaningful or necessary activities, thereby
            enhancing health, safety and well-being. Based on this assessment, they recommend
            modification and intervention strategies that improve the fit between the person and his
            or her environment.

        <description>Occupational therapists are experts at helping people lead as independent a
            life as possible. Occupational therapists bring an understanding of the physical and
            psychological implications of illness and injury and their effects on peoples' ability
            to perform the tasks of daily living. Occupational therapists provide interventions that
            can aide a person in completing ADL and IADL tasks, such as dressing, bathing, preparing
            meals, and driving. They also may fabricate custom orthotics to improve function,
            evaluate the environment for safety hazards and recommend adaptations to remove those
            hazards, help a person compensate for cognitive changes, and build a persons' physical
            endurance and strength. Occupational therapists' knowledge of adapting tasks and
            modifying the environment to compensate for functional limitations is used to increase
            the involvement of clients and to promote safety and success.

        <description>Occupational therapy assistants provide environmental modifications under the
            supervision of an occupational therapist. OTAs develop and implement an individualized
            occupational therapy environmental modification plan that reflects the relevant contexts
            of the client and relevant others and maximizes current and future occupational
            performance, safety, and participation of the client. Clients receive environmental
            modification recommendations and interventions that enable them to meet occupational
            performance and participation goals and that have adequate flexibility to accommodate
            for their future needs.

        <description>Orientation and Mobility (O&amp;M) specialists teach children and adults who
            have visual impairments the specific orientation skills used to find one's way in the
            environment and the mobility skills needed to travel safely and efficiently at home,
            school, work, and in the community. Instruction is usually provided one-on-one and can
            include skills such as how to use a long cane, the operation of low vision devices and
            electronic travel aids when appropriate, how to orient oneself to new environments,
            navigate public transportation systems, how to cross streets safely, and traveling by
            using hearing, remaining vision, and other senses. In addition, O&amp;M Specialists help
            children to develop fundamental skills such as fine and gross motor skills, concept
            development and problem solving skills. Adult clients can also benefit from an O&amp;M
            specialist evaluating their current use of travel-related skills, discussing their
            future goals, and helping them select a program of instruction that will allow them to
            reach their greatest travel potential.

        <category>therapy</category>
        <description>Athletic trainers are allied health care professionals who work in consultation
            with or under the direction of physicians, and specialize in the prevention, assessment,
            treatment and rehabilitation of injuries and illnesses. Currently, the entry-level
            employment requirements are a bachelor's degree with a major in athletic training from
            an accredited university or college. A majority of athletic trainers hold advanced
            degrees. National board certification is generally required as a condition of state
            licensure and employment. Most states regulate athletic trainers, and they practice
            within the scope of that license or regulation. Clinical practice includes emergency
            care, rehabilitation, reconditioning, therapeutic exercise, wellness programs, exercise
            physiology, kinesiology, biomechanics, nutrition, psychology and health care
            administration.

        <description>Trauma surgery is a recognized subspecialty of general surgery. Trauma surgeons
            are physicians who have completed a five-year general surgery residency and usually
            continue with a one to two year fellowship in trauma and/or surgical critical care,
            typically leading to additional board certification in surgical critical care. There is
            no trauma surgery board certification at this point. To obtain board certification in
            surgical critical care, a fellowship in surgical critical care or anesthesiology
            critical care must be completed during or after general surgery residency.

        <description>Occupational therapists provide interventions to clients of all ages with
            feeding, eating and swallowing difficulties. Occupational therapists provide
            comprehensive rehabilitative, habilitative, and palliative dysphagia care, which
            includes collaborating with clients to provide individualized compensatory swallowing
            strategies, modified diet textures, adapted mealtime environments, enhanced feeding
            skills, preparatory exercises and positioning to clients, reinforcement of mealtime
            strategies to enhance and improve swallowing skills, and training to caregivers to
            enhance eating and feeding performance. Occupational therapists provide screening and
            in-depth clinical assessment which may include instrumental dysphagia assessments
            including videofluroscopy.

        <description>Occupational therapists work with older adults in virtually every setting:
            assisted living, wellness programs, hospitals, nursing homes, senior centers, clinics
            and in the home. Occupational therapists bring an understanding of the importance of
            participation and occupation for overall well-being to those who are experiencing
            disabling conditions related to aging. The primary overarching goal of occupational
            therapy services with this population is to maximize independence and participation,
            thereby enabling an older person to continue to live successfully in his or her chosen
            environment. Occupational therapists can help older adults by developing strategies to
            help or maintain safety and well-being, to assist with life transitions, and to
            compensate for challenges they experience in activities of daily living, instrumental
            activities of daily living, leisure participation, social participation, and productive
            activities.

        <description>(1)Physical therapist assistants are skilled health care providers who are
            graduates of a physical therapist assistant associate degree program accredited by an
            agency recognized by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Education or Council on
            Postsecondary Accreditation, who assists the physical therapist in providing physical
            therapy. The supervising physical therapist is directly responsible for the actions of
            the physical therapist assistant. The PTA performs physical therapy procedures and
            related tasks that have been selected and delegated by the supervising physical
            therapist. Duties of the PTA include assisting the physical therapist in implementing
            treatment programs, training patients in exercised and activities of daily living,
            conducting treatments, and reporting to the physical therapist on the patient's
            responses. In addition to direct patient care, the PTA may also perform such functions
            as patient transport, and clinic or equipment preparation and maintenance. Currently
            more than half of all states require PTAs to be licensed, registered or certified. (2)
            An individual who works under the supervision of a physical therapist to assist him or
            her in providing physical therapy services. A physical therapy assistant may, for
            instance, help patients follow an appropriate exercise program that will increase their
            strength, endurance, coordination, and range of motion and train patients to perform
            activities of daily life.

        <description>Electrodiagnostic medicine is the medical subspecialty that applies
            neurophysiologic techniques to diagnose, evaluate, and treat patients with impairments
            of the neurologic, neuromuscular, and/or muscular systems. Qualified physicians are
            trained in performing electrophysiological testing and interpretation of the test data.
            They require knowledge in anatomy, physiology, kinesiology, histology, and pathology of
            the brain, spinal cord, autonomic nerves, cranial nerves, peripheral nerves,
            neuromuscular junction, and muscles. They must know clinical features and treatment of
            diseases of the central, peripheral, and autonomic nervous systems, as well as those of
            neuromuscular junction and muscle. Physicians also require special knowledge about
            electric signal processing, including waveform analysis, electronics and
            instrumentation, stimulation and recording equipment, and statistics.

        <description>Occupational therapists enable children and adults with visual impairment to
            engage in their chosen daily living activities safely and as independently as possible.
            This is accomplished by 1) teaching the person to use their remaining vision as
            efficiently as possible to complete activities; (2) modifying activities so that they
            can be completed with less vision; (3) training the person in use of adaptive equipment
            to compensate for vision loss, including high and low technology assistive devices; and
            (4) modifying the person's environment.

        <description>Occupational therapists provide treatment for people recovering from a mental
            or physical illness to regain their independence and stability and to engage in normal
            daily occupations (work, home, family life, school, leisure). Occupational therapists
            provide particular emphasis on interventions that result in improved quality of life and
            decrease hospitalization.

        <description>Occupational therapists provide services to infants, toddlers and children who
            have or who are at risk for developmental delays or disabilities. Occupational therapy
            is concerned with a child's ability to participate in daily life activities or
            "occupations." Occupational therapists use their unique expertise to help children with
            social-emotional, physical, cognitive, communication, and adaptive behavioral challenges
            and to help children to be prepared for and perform important learning and
            school-related activities and to fulfill their rule as students. Through an
            understanding of the impact of disability, illness, and impairment on a child's
            development, plan, ability to learn new skills, and overall occupational performance,
            occupational therapists design interventions that promote healthy development, establish
            needed skills, and/or modify environments, all in support of participation in daily
            activities.

            quality of line and health of adults and children by developing physical fitness,
            increasing mobility and independence, and improving psychosocial behavior. The
            kinesiotherapist seeks a coach-player relationship in which he/she helps the
            patient/client reach the goal of becoming an independent, self-sustaining person.
            Kinesiotherapists, as compared with physical therapists, put more emphasis on geriatric
            care, reconditioning and fitness, and psychiatric care. A large percentage of
            kinesiotherapists practice in Veterans Administration hospitals.

        <description>Occupational therapists can optimize and prolong an older driver's ability to
            drive safely and ease the transition to other forms of transportation if driving
            cessation becomes necessary. By identifying strengths as well as physical or cognitive
            challenges, occupational therapists can evaluate an individual's overall ability to
            operate a vehicle safely and recommend assistive devices or behavioral changes to limit
            risks. Occupational therapy practitioners offer a continuum of services related to
            community mobility, from evaluation of driving performance, through counseling and
            support for lifestyle changes, to maintaining independence and quality of life.
